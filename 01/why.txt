Hi! My Name is Kristina Hopkins. I’m a Graphic Designer at Network Media Partners. There, I design a bi-monthly print publication for the Association of YMCA Professionals (AYP) and work with Corinne (who’s also in our FEWD class) to design the tablet edition of the American Society of Training & Development (ASTD). I hope to learn how to not only build pretty websites in this class, but I’d also like to use the skills we learn in class to take the work I do on the tablet publication (created using Adobe’s Digital Publishing Suite) further through interactivity, animation, etc. within publications.

Some recent websites I’ve found to be inspiring:
http://bevisionare.com/ — I LOVE the transitions/animation that happen on the different “pages” of this site. I’m also a big fan of the single page site — short, sweet and to the point…and pretty to boot! Check out the “Look Inside” portion for a cool look at the mobile app with a thumb “swiping” thru the app.

http://builtbybuffalo.com/ — Love the simplicity of this site and using the hexagons to create a beautiful and different visual than what you see all over the Internet in designer portfolios.

http://harvestcreative.com/ — I really like how they took the idea of "Harvest" and just ran with it completely as an idea -- not only is the execution of this beautiful, you can just tell it's well thought out and planned.

http://futureofcarsharing.com — I love a good infographic. This one is awesome because it adds interactivity/animation using some of the technologies we'll be learning in the FEWD class (I hope!?) and I can see it being a really neat corner of the job market to serve.
